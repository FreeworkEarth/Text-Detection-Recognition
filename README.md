# Text-Detection-Recognition

# setup
If you want to run evaluation on COCO-Text dataset, download and unizip [train2014.zip](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip) to ./COCO directory.  
Then run the following script.
```shell
python eval_on_coco_text.py
```

# demo
If you just want ocr on images, run ctpn_crnn_pytorch.py.  
PyTorch version of CRNN yields much better result than Tensorflow version.
```shell
python ctpn_crnn_pytorch.py
```

# result
